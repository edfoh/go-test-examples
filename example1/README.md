## Different styles of testing

Broadly speaking, there are 3 different style to write tests that I have experienced / read about.

* Sub Tests
* Table Driven Tests
* Clousure Driven Tests


See [example1.1_test.go](./example1.1_test.go) for examples.

## Testing mocks functions

Although there are numerous mocking libraries for Golang, it is pretty easy to roll out your own and provide different mocking behaviors. [example1.2_test.go](./example1.2_test.go) demonstrates that using mocking functions for testing.
